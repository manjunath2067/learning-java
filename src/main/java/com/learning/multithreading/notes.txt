Deadlock Prevention Strategies:

1. Lock Ordering:
   - Always acquire locks in a consistent and predictable order.
   - Ensure all threads follow the same order when acquiring multiple locks.
   - Prevents circular wait condition.

2. Lock Timeout:
   - Set a timeout for acquiring locks.
   - If a thread cannot acquire a lock within the timeout period, it releases all locks and retries later.
   - Prevents threads from waiting indefinitely and causing deadlock.

3. Avoid Nested Locks:
   - Minimize or avoid acquiring multiple locks within a critical section.
   - If nested locks are necessary, ensure outer locks are acquired before inner locks.

4. Lock Hierarchy:
   - Establish a lock hierarchy and ensure threads acquire locks in ascending order according to the hierarchy.
   - Enforces a global lock acquisition order, preventing deadlock.

5. Use Reentrant Locks:
   - Reentrant locks provide features like fairness and try-lock.
   - Can help prevent deadlock situations.

6. Deadlock Detection:
   - Implement deadlock detection mechanisms.
   - Techniques such as resource allocation graph and cycle detection algorithms can be employed.

7. Avoid Blocking Operations:
   - Minimize time spent holding locks, especially during I/O operations or accessing shared resources.
   - Reduces contention and likelihood of deadlock.

8. Keep Critical Sections Small:
   - Reduce the amount of code within critical sections.
   - Break down complex operations into smaller units to reduce the risk of deadlock.
